                            What's the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows?

                                The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's
                                processor (also called a CPU) handles information. The 64-bit
                                version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory
                                (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system. Not all devices can
                                run the 64-bit versions of Windows.

                                simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
                                been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
                                unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                                popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                                Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                                like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
